1. Copy the directory "asr_validation_project" along with its contents to the Master server.

2. After copying, login to the Master server and go to the copied directory. You should be under "asr_validation_project/".

3. Set the system wide proxy:
    echo 'export http_proxy="http://www-proxy.us.oracle.com:80"' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
    echo 'export https_proxy="https://www-proxy.us.oracle.com:80"' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
    source /etc/bash.bashrc

4. Now run: apt update -y && apt install python -y && apt install ansible -y && apt install docker.io -y

5. If you encounter "Resource temporarily unavailable" ERROR run the following commands and try again:
      sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
      sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
      sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

6. Execute the "setup.py" script by typing - "python setup.py" and enter the prompts as required. 

7. The ansible target systems should be updated and python along with docker must be installed.
   Log in to the ansible target systems and RUN:
       apt update -y && apt install python -y && apt install docker.io -y

8. Once done, test if ansible can ping the target systems:

       RUN: ansible -i inventory -m ping <GROUP_NAME>
